                    <h1> What Are Video Games? </h1>
                    <p> A computer (or video) game is a computer-controlled game where players interact with objects displayed on a
                        screen for the sake of
                        entertainment.
                        The term "computer game" also includes games which display only text or which use other methods, such as
                        sound
                        or vibration, as their
                        primary feedback device, or a controller (console games), or a combination of any of the above.

                    <h1>A Bit Of History</h1>
                    <p> The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academic computer scientists began
                        designing simple
                        games and simulations as part of their research or just for fun. At M.I.T. in the 1960s, professors and
                        students played games
                        such as 3D tic-tac-toe and Moon Landing. These games were played on computer such as the IBM 1560, and moves
                        were made by means
                        of punch cards.</p>
                    <p>Video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s, when video arcade games and
                        gaming
                        consoles using joysticks, buttons, and other controllers, along with graphics on computer screens and home
                        computer games were
                        introduced to the general public. Since the 1980s, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment
                        and
                        a part of modern
                        popular culture in most parts of the world. One of the early games was Spacewar!, which was developed by
                        computer scientists.
                        Early arcade video games developed from 1972 to 1978.</p>
                    <p>During the 1970s, the first generation of home consoles emerged, including
                        the popular game Pong and various "clones". The 1970s was also the era of mainframe computer games. The
                        golden
                        age of
                        arcade video games was from 1978 to 1982. Video arcades with large, graphics-decorated coin-operated machines
                        were common
                        at malls and popular, affordable home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision enabled people to
                        play
                        games on
                        their home TVs.</p>
                    <p>During the 1980s, gaming computers, early online gaming and handheld LCD games emerged; this era was
                        affected by the video game crash of 1983. From 1976 to 1992, the second generation of video consoles emerged.</p>
